## üöÄ Deployment

1. Clone this repository, and enter this function folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/open-runtimes/examples.git && cd examples
$ cd deno/deepgram_audio_summary
```

2. Enter this function folder and build the code:

```
docker run -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=src/mod.ts --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/usr/code openruntimes/deno:v2-1.21 sh /usr/local/src/build.sh
```

As a result, a `code.tar.gz` file will be generated.

3. Start the Open Runtime:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=src/mod.ts -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_KEY=secret-key --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD/code.tar.gz:/tmp/code.tar.gz:ro openruntimes/deno:v2-1.21 sh /usr/local/src/start.sh
```

4. In the new terminal execute the following function:
```
curl -H "X-Internal-Challenge: secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/ -d ' {
   "payload": "{\"fileUrl\": \"https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview_speech-analytics.wav\"}",
	
    "variables": {
        "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY": "Your APIKey"
    }
}'
```

Your function is now listening on port `3000`, and you can execute it by sending `POST` request with appropriate authorization headers. To learn more about runtime, you can visit Deno runtime [README](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes/tree/main/runtimes/deno-1.24).

## üìù Notes

- This function is designed for use with Appwrite Cloud Functions. You can learn more about it in [Appwrite docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions).
- This example is compatible with Deno 1.21 and 1.24. Other versions may work but are not guarenteed to work as they haven't been tested.
