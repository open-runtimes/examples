## Contributing

All code contributions - including those of people having commit access - must go through a pull request and be approved by a core developer before being merged. This is to ensure a proper review of all the code.

All functions should have the exactly same functionality as their other language counterparts and if possible you should avoid using any third-party libraries to keep the functions simple and secure.

We truly ❤️ pull requests! If you wish to help, you can learn more about how you can contribute to this project in the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
