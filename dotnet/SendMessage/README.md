## üöÄ Deployment

<!-- To do:
1. Update the deployment section  -->

There are two ways of deploying the Appwrite function, both having the same results, but each using a different process. 

### Using CLI

Make sure you have [Appwrite CLI](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line#installation) installed, and you have successfully logged into your Appwrite server. To make sure Appwrite CLI is ready, you can use the command `appwrite client --debug` and it should respond with green text `‚úì Success`.

Make sure you are in the same folder as your `appwrite.json` file and run `appwrite deploy function` to deploy your function. You will be prompted to select which functions you want to deploy.

### Manual Deployment 

Manual deployment has no requirements and uses Appwrite Console to deploy the tag. First, enter the folder of your function. Then, create a tarball of the whole folder and gzip it using the following command. In order to create a tar ball. Enter this command to build the code.
```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty \
  -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=Index.cs \
  --volume $PWD:/usr/code \
  openruntimes/dotnet:v2-6.0 sh \
  /usr/local/src/build.sh
```  
Then
```
tar -czf code.tar.gz --exclude code.tar.gz .
```

After creating `.tar.gz` file, visit Appwrite Console, click on the `Create deployment` button and switch to the `Manual` tab. There, set the `entrypoint` to `Index.cs`, and upload the file we just generated.

### Executing the function without the Appwrite Console

After you have built the code with the command above, run the following up command to start a server to listen to your request on your local host.
```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_KEY=secret-key \
  -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=Index.cs \
  --volume $PWD/code.tar.gz:/tmp/code.tar.gz:ro \
  openruntimes/dotnet:v2-6.0 \
  sh /usr/local/src/start.sh
```
Your function is now listening on port `3000`, and you can execute it by sending `POST` request with appropriate authorization headers.

Sample execution using curl
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ -d '{"variables": {"DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL":"YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"},"payload": "{\"type\": \"Discord\",\"message\": \"Programming is fun!\",}"}' -H "X-Internal-Challenge: secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## üìù Notes
