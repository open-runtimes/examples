### Using CLI

For instrunctions on using the Appwrite CLI check https://appwrite.io/docs/functions#deployFunction

### Manual using tar.gz

Manual deployment has no requirements and uses Appwrite Console to deploy the tag. First, enter the folder of your function. Then, create a tarball of the whole folder and gzip it. After creating `.tar.gz` file, visit Appwrite Console, click on the `Deploy Tag` button and switch to the `Manual` tab. There, set the `entrypoint` to `src/Index.kt`, and upload the file just generated.
