# üîâüìÉ Summarize Audio with Deepgram

A Python Cloud Function for summarizing audio number using [Deepgram API](https://deepgram.com/).

_Example input:_

```json
{
    "fileUrl": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview_speech-analytics.wav"
}
```

_Example output:_


```json
{
    "success": true,
    "deepgramData": {}
}
```

## üìù Environment Variables

List of environment variables used by this cloud function:

- **DEEPGRAM_API_KEY** - Deepgram API Key

‚ÑπÔ∏è _Create your Deepgram API key at console.deepgram.com_

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Clone this repository, and enter this function folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-runtimes/examples.git && cd examples
cd python/deepgram-language-detection
```

2. Enter this function folder and build the code:
```bash
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/usr/code openruntimes/python:v2-3.10 sh /usr/local/src/build.sh
```
As a result, a `code.tar.gz` file will be generated.

3. Start the Open Runtime:
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_KEY=secret-key -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=main.py --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD/code.tar.gz:/tmp/code.tar.gz:ro openruntimes/python:v2-3.10 sh /usr/local/src/start.sh
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` without your key.
Your function is now listening on port `3000`, and you can execute it by sending `POST` request with appropriate authorization headers. To learn more about runtime, you can visit Python runtime [README](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes/tree/main/openruntimes/python:v2-3.10).
4. Run the cURL function to send request.
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/ -H "X-Internal-Challenge: secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"payload": {"fileUrl": "https://static.deepgram.com/examples/interview_speech-analytics.wav"}, "variables": {"DEEPGRAM_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"}}'
```
## üìù Notes
- This function is designed for use with Appwrite Cloud Functions. You can learn more about it in [Appwrite docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions).
- This example is compatible with Python 3.10. Other versions may work but are not guaranteed to work as they haven't been tested.
