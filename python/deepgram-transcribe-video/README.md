```json
{
  "fileUrl": "https://rawcdn.githack.com/deepgram-devs/transcribe-videos/62fc7769d6e2bf38e420ee5224060922af4546f7/deepgram.mp4"
}
```

_Successful function response::_

```json
{ "deepgramData": {}, "success": true }
```

_Error function response:_

```

## üìù Variables

List of variables used by this cloud function:

**DEEPGRAM_API_KEY** - Your Deepgram API key.

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Clone this repository, and enter this function folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/open-runtimes/examples.git && cd examples
$ cd python/deepgram-transcribe-video
```

2. Enter this function folder and build the code:

```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/usr/code openruntimes/python:v2-3.10 sh /usr/local/src/build.sh
```

As a result, a `code.tar.gz` file will be generated.

3. Start the Open Runtime:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_KEY=secret-key -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=main.py --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD/code.tar.gz:/tmp/code.tar.gz:ro openruntimes/python:v2-3.10 sh /usr/local/src/start.sh
```

Your function is now listening on port `3000`, and you can execute it by sending `POST` request with appropriate authorization headers. To learn more about runtime, you can visit Python runtime [README](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes/tree/main/runtimes/python-3.10).

4. Curl Command

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/ -d '{"variables": {"DEEPGRAM_API_KEY":"<YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY>"},"payload": "{\"fileUrl\":\"https://rawcdn.githack.com/deepgram-devs/transcribe-videos/62fc7769d6e2bf38e420ee5224060922af4546f7/deepgram.mp4\" }"
}' -H "X-Internal-Challenge: secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## üìù Notes

- This function is designed for use with Appwrite Cloud Functions. You can learn more about it in [Appwrite docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions).
- This example is compatible with Python 3.10. Other versions may work but are not guaranteed to work as they haven't been tested.
