## üìù Environment Variables

List of environment variables used by this cloud function:

- **APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT** - Endpoint of Appwrite project
- **APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY** - Appwrite API Key
- **APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID** - Appwrite project ID. If running on Appwrite, this variable is provided automatically.

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Clone this repository, and enter this function folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/open-runtimes/examples.git && cd examples
$ cd php/wipe_appwrite_bucket
```

2. Enter this function folder and build the code:
```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/usr/code openruntimes/php:v2-8.1 sh /usr/local/src/build.sh
```
As a result, a `code.tar.gz` file will be generated.

3. Start the Open Runtime:
```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_KEY=secret-key -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=index.php --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD/code.tar.gz:/tmp/code.tar.gz:ro openruntimes/php:v2-8.1 sh /usr/local/src/start.sh
```

Your function is now listening on port `3000`, and you can execute it by sending `POST` request with appropriate authorization headers. To learn more about runtime, you can visit PHP runtime [README](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes/tree/main/runtimes/php-8.1).

4. Execute function:

```
curl http://localhost:3000/ -d '{"variables":{"APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ENDPOINT":"YOUR_ENDPOINT","APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID":"YOUR_PROJECT_ID","APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY":"YOUR_API_KEY"},"payload":"{\"bucketId\":\"profilePictures\"}"}' -H "X-Internal-Challenge: secret-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## üìù Notes
 - This function is designed for use with Appwrite Cloud Functions. You can learn more about it in [Appwrite docs](https://appwrite.io/docs/functions).
 - This example is compatible with PHP 8.1. Other versions may work but are not guaranteed to work as they haven't been tested.
