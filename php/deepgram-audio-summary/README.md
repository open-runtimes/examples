## üöÄ Deployment

1. Clone this repository, and enter this function folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/open-runtimes/examples.git && cd examples
$ cd php/deepgram-audio-summary
```

2. Enter this function folder and build the code:

```
docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD:/usr/code openruntimes/php:v2-8.1 sh /usr/local/src/build.sh
```

As a result, a `code.tar.gz` file will be generated.

3. Start the Open Runtime:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_KEY=secret-key -e INTERNAL_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT=index.php --rm --interactive --tty --volume $PWD/code.tar.gz:/tmp/code.tar.gz:ro openruntimes/php:v2-8.1 sh /usr/local/src/start.sh
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` without your key.

Your function is now listening on port `3000`, and you can execute it by sending `POST` request with appropriate authorization headers. To learn more about runtime, you can visit PHP runtime [README](https://github.com/open-runtimes/open-runtimes/tree/main/runtimes/php-8.1).

## üìù Notes
